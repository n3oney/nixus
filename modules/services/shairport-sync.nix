     //	When a new play session starts, it usually requests a suggested volume level from Shairport Sync. This is normally the volume level of the last session.

     //	Thus, the user could be unpleasantly surprised by the volume level of the new session.

     //	high_threshold_airplay_volume = -16.0; // airplay volume greater or equal to this is "very loud"
     //	high_volume_idle_timeout_in_minutes = 0; // if the current volume is "very loud" and the device is not playing for more than this time, suggest the default volume for new connections instead of the current volume.
     //		Note 1: This timeout is set to 0 by default to disable this feature. Set it to some positive number, e.g. 180 to activate the feature.

     //		The desired AirPlay volume is appended to the end of the command line â€“ leave a space if you want it treated as an extra argument.
