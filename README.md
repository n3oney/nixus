# nixus

my NixOS system configuration.

This config is daily-driven by me on my PC.
I have some packages here that you can use, however this flake **requires** nix patched with thunk support for inputs.
You can use [nix-super](https://github.com/privatevoid-net/nix-super) for this, or patch it manually.
